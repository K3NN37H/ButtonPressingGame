When you are done with your changes and are ready to save it to the repository so we can get it.

1. Make sure your file is saved at File Menu > Save All
2. Tools Menu > Git > Pull
3. In the console text box at the bottom of the screen, type exactly:
git add *
4. Tools Menu > Git > Commit
5. The console at the bottom of the screen should have some text in it, add a message in quotes to the end of it to summarize what you did.  The command should look something like this afterwards:
git commit -m "a message here"
6. Tools Menu > Git > Push

If you utterly screw something up and you need to revert back to before you did ANYTHING, type:
git checkout -f
